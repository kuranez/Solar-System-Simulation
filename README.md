# Solar System Simulation
2D simulation of our solar system using pygame. \
Based on the [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTLPmUHTPqo) tutorial by [@techwithtim](https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Planet-Simulation) 
and inspired by tweaks and additions by [@zerot69](https://github.com/zerot69/Solar-System-Simulation). 
 \
  \
 **Features:**
 - Orbits of inner and outer planets of our solar system
 - Using real astronomical data from NASA
 - Basic commands to scale and speed up the simulation 

**New to Version 1.2:**
- Improved Scaling
- Improved Orbit trails
